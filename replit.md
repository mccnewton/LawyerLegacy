## Data Flow

### Static Content Delivery
1. HTML pages served directly from web server
2. CSS and JavaScript assets loaded via CDN (Bootstrap, Font Awesome) and local files
3. No server-side processing or database interactions
4. Client-side JavaScript handles UI interactions and animations

### User Interactions
1. Navigation between pages via standard HTTP requests
2. Form submissions (contact forms) would require backend integration
3. JavaScript handles smooth scrolling and visual feedback
4. Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: UI framework and responsive utilities
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Icon library for visual elements

### Third-Party Integrations
- Currently no external API integrations
- Contact forms would require email service integration (future enhancement)
- Analytics tracking could be added (Google Analytics, etc.)

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting
- **Approach**: Static file hosting suitable for GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or traditional web servers
- **Build Process**: No build step required - direct file deployment
- **Performance**: Fast loading with CDN-delivered assets and minimal JavaScript

### Future Considerations
- **Content Management**: Could be enhanced with headless CMS for blog content
- **Contact Forms**: Backend service needed for form processing and email delivery
- **Analytics**: Third-party analytics service integration for visitor tracking
- **SEO**: Already optimized with proper meta tags and semantic HTML

### Scalability
- Current architecture supports adding more pages easily
- JavaScript is modular and can be extended
- CSS variables allow for easy theme customization
